/* sdlbeep - SDL3's DOS audio (the Sound Blaster driver: DMA, IRQ, and the
 * ring its cooperative audio thread fills): a 440 Hz tone for two seconds.
 * Loop A runs it with an SB16, BLASTER set and --wav, and looks for the tone
 * in the recording (tools/sdl/loopa.sh). SDL_Delay is what lets the audio
 * thread run: the scheduler switches only at yields.
 *
 *   SDLBEEP [--busy MS]   the main thread works MS milliseconds between
 *                         yields (one SDL_Delay(0) each; with no video,
 *                         SDL_PumpEvents does not yield): a game that yields
 *                         once a frame; the tone must not break up
 *
 * Either way, no chunk may underrun: the driver counts the chunks the card
 * played as silence because the ring was empty (SDL patch 0005). */
