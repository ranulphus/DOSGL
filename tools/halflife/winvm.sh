# PS/2 mouse with CuteMouse; D: holds HLDGL.EXE (build/halflife, from the
# pinned forks) and the owner's WON data (tools/halflife/fixtures.py). The
# zip contains retail data: it is for the owner's machine only, never to be
# shared or committed.

What is on D: (D:\ is on PATH)
  HL.BAT        Type HL to play Half-Life (your WON copy, D:\HL\VALVE) in
                Xash3D FWGS on DOS-GL, on the Matrox card. Options go to the
                game: -width 800 -height 600 (or 320x240 ... 1280x1024), -nosound.
  D:\HL         HLDGL.EXE (the engine, the game code and DOS-GL in one DJGPP
                program), DOSLFN.COM (long file names; HL.BAT loads it).

Playing: the WON defaults apply: W A S D or the arrow keys, the mouse to look
and fire, F6 quick save, F7 quick load (not F9), ` for the console, Escape
for the menu. Sound comes from the Sound Blaster 16 (BLASTER in RUN.BAT).
A video mode chosen in the menu applies at the next start.

Known gaps: VGUI text (the multiplayer scoreboard) is missing, since the WON
data has no VGUI fonts; there are no intro videos; multiplayer is local only.
86Box runs the Matrox 3D engine much slower than the real card: expect a few
frames a second here, not what a Pentium II with a G450 does.

This zip holds retail game data: keep it on your own machine.
