# Half-Life on DOS-GL (plan halflife-dos.md, Part H): the forks of Xash3D FWGS
# (engine, renderer, menu) and hlsdk-portable (Half-Life's game code), each
# with a DJGPP target, pinned by commit. tools/halflife/build.sh reads these
# lines. Their submodules come at the commits the forks' gitlinks pin, with
# the forks' patch series (scripts/djgpp/patches) applied.
